I have taken a dataset named "Coffee_Chain_Sales" from kaggle.
This Interactive Dashboard contains various visualizations, comparing different metrics on different pages.
It has a Summary Page, Performance Page, Sales and Profit Page, and Geography Page. Each page has different
Charts, Map, Cards, Slicers for "State", "Product" and "Year.Month.Day", etc.
The pages can be navigated through "buttons" that is on the left side of each page.
I have used features like hover, 100% transparency for border of unselected buttons, 0% transparency for border
os the selected button. Ctrl + Click on the desired button to follow the link. 
You can View Dataset, Power BI Dashboard and Screenshots.
